B Trees and B+ Trees , how it helpful in the SQL and indexing 


SQL store its data in the indexing form with the B+ Tree format which arrange and it self maintain the sorted order , but still this store linearly based on PK as provided by the user or uses the hidden byte PK generated by the SQL itself

What is B-tree - is self organizing tree , which works on the concept of m-way tree , which says a node can have m-1 key and m child , but there is some limitation in the m-way key , there is no boundness  how many key  should be store in the node so , B-tree comes into the picture , which impose some rule on the  m-way tree and that are all leaf node should at same level , there should be [m/2]  key present in the child node .

B-tree store three information , key , child-pointer and data pointer 
But a slight change is done in the B+ tree that all parent node should present in the leaf node and data pointer is only present in the  leaf node .

what force to make these amendment -> The most important that the data is store in the child and middle node leaves to many and cleanness problem the key are storing , but less in number , by putting the store data  in last  the  structure look good and all data are present in the last leaf node and the depth reduced .
