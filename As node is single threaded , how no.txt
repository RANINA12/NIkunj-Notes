As node is single threaded , how node handle 10000 requests concurrently ?

Earlier Java handle multiple request concurrently with the help of the threads , but later it also shift to async wait and all this concept how it works we need to study ?

How and what is happening is crucial it based on the design of the language , how it handle the code  process 


Yes , Node is  single threaded ,  but at the same time Node can handle multiple request , this happens because , the non blocking code is shifted to the  C++ library  (libvu) , it do all the hard work and event loop tell once the process is completed  .

What are the non blocking code ?? And yes if the code are Blocking in nature then one request is handle at a one time .

Non blocking codes are -> 
fetch(url)
axios.get(url)
http.request(...)
https.request(...)
await mongoose.find()
await prisma.user.findMany()
await pg.query()
await mysql.query()
fs.readFile("a.txt", cb)
fs.writeFile("a.txt", data, cb)
fs.promises.readFile("a.txt")
setTimeout(fn, 0)
setInterval(fn, 1000)
setImmediate(fn)
