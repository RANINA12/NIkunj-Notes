Virtualization is a technique used to share physical hardware resources (CPU, RAM, disk, network) among multiple isolated environments, commonly used in cloud computing.

Using virtualization, multiple virtual machines can run on a single physical machine, where each virtual machine behaves like an independent computer with its own operating system.

Each operating system running inside a virtual machine feels that it owns the hardware, even though the actual hardware is shared. This illusion is created by a component called the hypervisor.

The hypervisor sits between the hardware and the virtual machines. It allocates hardware resources to each virtual machine and ensures isolation, so that one operating system or application cannot interfere with another.

With the help of virtualization, we can create multiple virtual environments on a single physical machine and run different operating systems securely and efficiently.

When Ubuntu is installed as a virtual machine, it runs as a guest operating system with its own Linux kernel, independent of the host operating system (Windows or macOS).
Inside the Ubuntu VM:
Ubuntu believes it has full control over the CPU, memory, disk, and network.
The CPU instructions generated by Ubuntu programs run directly on the real CPU.
The hypervisor controls access, but does not translate or modify Ubuntu instructions.
Ubuntu uses its own system calls, own libraries, and own file system.
Compilation in Ubuntu VM
Code is compiled inside the Ubuntu VM, not by Windows.
The compiler (GCC / Clang) is installed inside Ubuntu.
Ubuntu produces Linux-specific binaries (ELF).
Windows does not understand or participate in this compilation.
Execution in Ubuntu VM
Ubuntu executes its compiled binary using the Linux kernel.
The hypervisor maps Ubuntu’s virtual CPU and memory to the real hardware.
Windows only sees the VM as a running process; it does not execute Ubuntu code.
